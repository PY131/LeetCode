Given a non-emptyÂ array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, 
which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example 1:
    Input: [2,2,3,2]
    Output: 3

Example 2:
    Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
    Output: 99
