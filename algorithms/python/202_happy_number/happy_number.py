Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is "happy".
A happy number is a number defined by the following process: 
    Starting with any positive integer, 
    replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, 
    and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), 
    or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. 
    Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Return True if n is a happy number, and False if not.

Example:Â 
    Input: 19
    Output: true
    Explanation: 
        12 + 92 = 82
        82 + 22 = 68
        62 + 82 = 100
        12 + 02 + 02 = 1
